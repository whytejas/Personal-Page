<p> Hello!  I am <strong>Tejas</strong>, 29, a resident of Paris, France. 
<br><br>

    In my early teens, I created a Harry Potter fan-site using HTML-based software. Back then, I also chose my first Gmail ID using the initial of my last name (Y) and my first name (Tejas). Over the years, people have misconstrued it as a pun on <strong>"Why Tejas?"</strong>. Paradoxically, I consider myself a rational-creative  who continually asks <em>"Why not?"</em> of himself and of life. 
<br>
<br>
I am teaching myself web-development from scratch.  So, everything you see on here has been created by me. I plan to add more content and styles as I continue learning. For now, feel free to browse my book reviews.
<br>
<br>
Thanks for stopping by today!
